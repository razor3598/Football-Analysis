Scraped data from https://understat.com/

The data is all shots taken across the 5 major European leagues: English Premier League, La Liga, Bundesliga, Serie A, Ligue 1

In this script, I've considered only players who scored more than 5 goals in the 2020-21 season. Appropriate changes can be made as per requirement.
